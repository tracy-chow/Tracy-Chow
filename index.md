# Welcome to my GitHub Page!

Hello! My name is Tracy and here are a few of my projects.

## [Short Vowels Game](https://github.com/tracy-chow/Short-Vowels-Game/blob/main/Final-Project-R_Controlled-Vowels-Game-master/index.html)

I made this interactive game for my first graders. It's also my very first Javascript project.

## [Wedding Website](https://github.com/tracy-chow/weddingWebpage/blob/main/tchow99.github.io-master/index.html)

Not wanting to pay for a website or get a free cookie-cutter one, I put my front-end web development knowledge into practice with 1 month before I had to push out the website.
